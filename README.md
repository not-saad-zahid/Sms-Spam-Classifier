# 📱 SMS Spam Classifier
A machine learning project to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) SMS messages. Built with Jupyter Notebook and Python.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares SMS text data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from message content.
- Model Training: Uses ML algorithms to classify SMS messages.
- Evaluation Metrics: Measures performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interactive Analysis: Step-by-step exploration in Jupyter Notebook.
## 🏁 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/not-saad-zahid/Sms-Spam-Classifier.git
cd Sms-Spam-Classifier
2. Install Dependencies
Most requirements are standard Python data science libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Notebook
Open SMS_Spam_Classifier.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to follow the analysis and experiment with the code.

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses a labeled SMS dataset with both spam and ham messages. All data is preprocessed and vectorized for ML tasks.

## 💡 Usage
- Train the classifier and evaluate its performance.
- Use the provided code to classify new SMS messages.
- Experiment with different models and feature engineering techniques.
