# SMS Spam Classifier
This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that leverages machine learning techniques to distinguish between spam and legitimate (ham) SMS messages. Built primarily using Jupyter Notebook and Python, this solution enables users to filter out unwanted messages, thus improving communication efficiency and security.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares SMS text data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from message content.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify messages.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interactive Analysis: Jupyter Notebook format allows step-by-step exploration and customization.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/not-saad-zahid/Sms-Spam-Classifier.git
cd Sms-Spam-Classifier
```
Install Dependencies Most requirements are standard Python data science libraries. Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Notebook Open SMS_Spam_Classifier.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to follow the analysis and experiment with the code.

**Dataset**
The project uses a labeled SMS dataset containing both spam and ham messages. The data is preprocessed and vectorized for machine learning tasks.

## Usage
Train the classifier and evaluate its performance.
Use the provided code to classify new SMS messages.
Experiment with different models and feature engineering techniques.
